## Getting Started

### Starting the Server

1. Navigate to the server directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install server dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

   The server will be running on `http://localhost:8000/api/users`.

### Starting the Client

1. Navigate to the client directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install client dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React app:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The React app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `server`: Express server that serves user data.
- `client`: React app that fetches and displays user data.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure the server is running before starting the client.
- The server runs on port 8000, and the client runs on port 3000 by default.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
